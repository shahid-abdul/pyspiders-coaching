Python data structures are classified into 2 types
1. Sequential
    - Store data in continuous location
    - index, slicing
    - Ex: [str - sequence of characters], range()

2. Collection
    - These are unordered
    - Direct access to any elements
    - Ex: [dictionary - stores in the form of key value pair]
