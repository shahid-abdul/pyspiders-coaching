1. range(stop): ---> generate sequence of numbers
2. range(start,stop): ---> generate sequence of numbers from 0 to stop-1 (stop number is excluded)
3. range(start,stop,step): ---> generate sequence of numbers from start to stop with a step value.
    --> step value should not be zero
    --> if step value is 0 - value error

Rules: 
1. When incrementing frist number should be less than second number.
2. When decrementing first number should be greater than second number.
3. When start and stop values are same, That returns empty list

break and continue statements:
    - They will alter program execution
1. break
    - for loop
        break
    exit from the code

2. continue
    - for loop inner
        for loop outer
            break
        exit outer
